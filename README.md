# fluxbox

Personal setup for a distraction free environment.

* Divides workspace into six desktops, each with a distinct function.

* Borders are ommitted when possible.

* Layout of windows is set as far as possible.

* Relies on [Solarized](https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/).

* Uses [PerfectDay](https://github.com/abhle/PerfectDay) as style.

* Requieres [Yad](https://github.com/v1cont/yad) for choice of theme.

All of this could likely achieved easier and better with i3.

I hammered this out a long time ago, and it worked for me. So, at 
the moment, I see no need to change. This is meant to be a alternative,
in a sense free software is meant to be.
